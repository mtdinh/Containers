# Container Hub to Support Traceable and Reproducible Workflows

This project seeks to extend container hub functionality to better support a fully containerized workflow environment enabling traceability and reproducibility. In particular, this is the backend work to support a front-end being developed by a Georgia Tech Junior Design Class Team.

An example of the front-end is here:
